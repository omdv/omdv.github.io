## Chapter 1: Energy and Society

Energy as the only universal currency, required to get anything done through transformations between many of its kinds.

*If we can find a single to represent an idea which applies to every element in our existence in a way that makes us feel we have a genuine grasp of it, we have achieved anything economical and powerful. This is what has happened with the idea expressed by the word energy*, Robert Lindsay, 1975

According to Feynman (1988) *... in physics today, we have no knowledge of what energy is. We do not have a picture that energy comes in little blobs of a definite amount.* However throughout 19th and 20th centuries we perfected our knowledge of energy transformations.

Animals are iherently energy limited by the size of their bodies and availability of nutrition. Our species, through the use of intellect, were able to extend these limitations by the use of intellect. We reached the current state through several milestones, such as using basic tools to acquire more food, domesticating animals, use of simple tools to harvest kinetic energy (e.g. sails, water mills), controlled combustion (i.e. translation of chemical energy of plants to thermal) and finally nuclear and photovoltaic, so on.

First law of thermodynamics postulates the conservation of energy during all transformations. Second law postulates that during every conversion there is a loss of useful energy which is related to the entropy of the system. Increase of entropy is the reduction of energy utility. Few examples - at least 60% of coal's energy is lost as heat in coal plant, 95% of delivered electricity is lost as heat in electric bulbs.

Some fundamental properties are following below. **Energy**, measured as joules, calories, British thermal units. **Power** is the rate of energy flow, SI unit is watt, after James Watt. **Energy density** is the amount of energy per unit mass of resource.

Note that average adult daily food need is around 2-2.7 Mcal (the plot below is in Kcal). Consuming this amount of energy per day corresponds to a power rate of 90 W (8 MJ / 24 h x 3,600 s), which is roughly a rating of a standard light bulb, while double toaster needs 1 kW.

**Power density** is the rate at which power is produced or consumer per unit of area. For instance the power density of dry wood is about 0.6 W/m2. Preindustrial cities relying on firewood required a fuel from area 30-50 its own size, while cities using charcoal (adding firewood to charcoal conversion) required areas at least 100 times its size. These factors limited the growth of cities even when other resources were available.

**Efficiency of energy conversion** have increased from 0.01% for chemical energy to light conversion in candles to about 9% now with gas-powered plants and LEDs, which is 2 orders of magnitude improvement. Note, however, that it is still only 9% efficient. Also increase in efficienty does not lead to decrease in overall consumption. On contrary, Stanley Jevons paradox (1865) states that with an increase in efficiency of a particular technology leads to more consumers and as a result an increased consumption.

**Energy returns** measure the ratio of produced energy to consumed. In traditional farming it is a ratio of energy produced by crop and energy consumed by horses and farmers. It has to be much higher than one to be viable. At the same time if we consider a modern farming with the use of machinery and high energy density fuels this ratio is substantially lower than for traditional farming. It is however, strictly not a fair "apple to apple" comparison.

**Energy intensity** measures the energy cost to produce a unit of mass of specific material. Aluminum and plastics are very energy intensive due to technological complexity of the process, while stone and sand have very low energy cost.

**Energy cost of energy or energy return on energy investment** allows to compare different sources of energy. Care must be taken as this changes significantly with the improvement of technology and can vary geographically. Coal EROEI is between 10 and 80, oil may be anywhere from 10 to well past 100, wind turbines are mostly less than 10, solar panels less than 2, biofuels are 1.5 at best. Such estimations, however, ignore the differences between renewable and non-renewable sources of energy.

There is no generally accepted way to calculate the energy cost of human labor. Author suggests to use 30% of average BMR or 2 MJ/day for use in all foraging and farming calculations. There are studies which estimate muscle efficiency to be about 20%, which means 2 MJ/day will produce 400 kJ/day of useful work. Another way to calculate it is just to account for energy cost of all food consumed, which is about 3.9 GJ/capita per annum.
